## Problem

- Alice and Bob have a different total number of candies. You are given two integer arrays aliceSizes and bobSizes where aliceSizes[i] is the number of candies of the ith box of candy that Alice has and bobSizes[j] is the number of candies of the jth box of candy that Bob has. Since they are friends, they would like to exchange one candy box each so that after the exchange, they both have the same total amount of candy. The total amount of candy a person has is the sum of the number of candies in each box they have. Return an integer array answer where answer[0] is the number of candies in the box that Alice must exchange, and answer[1] is the number of candies in the box that Bob must exchange. If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them. It is guaranteed that at least one answer exists.

## Constraints
- 1 <= aliceSizes.length, bobSizes.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= aliceSizes[i], bobSizes[j] <= 10^5
- Alice and Bob have a different total number of candies.
- There will be at least one valid answer for the given input.

## Example
- Input: aliceSizes = [1,2], bobSizes = [2,3]
- Output: [1,2]

## 풀이
```python
    def fairCandySwap(self, aliceSizes: List[int], bobSizes: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ta, tb, bobSizes = sum(aliceSizes), sum(bobSizes), set(bobSizes)
        after = (ta + tb) // 2

        for e in aliceSizes:
            if (expected := after - (ta - e)) in bobSizes:
                return [e, expected]
```
: 이 문제는 엘리스와 밥의 사탕을 동일하게 나눠주는 일이다. 여기서 새로운 문법을 배우게 되었는데 바로 ```:=```이다. 이것은 ```바다코끼리 연산자(the walrus operator)```라고 한다. ```expected = after - (ta-e)``` ```if expected in bobSizes``` 이 두줄을 합쳐서 보여줄 수 있는 문법이다. 대입한 후 조건문 검사를 할 때 많이 사용한다.
